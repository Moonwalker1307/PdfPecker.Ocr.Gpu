# Third-party notices

PdfPecker.Ocr.Gpu is licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`). The package bundles neural network models that are
third-party works under the Apache License 2.0; they are listed here. This file ships with the package. In SPDX terms
the package is `MIT AND Apache-2.0`.

The package depends on the [PdfPecker.Ocr](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PdfPecker.Ocr) and
[Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed) NuGet packages,
which are installed separately and carry their own notices; none of their code is copied into this package. The native
ONNX Runtime build the application adds (with CUDA, cuDNN or DirectML) carries its own licences too.

## PaddleOCR models, as packaged by RapidOCR 3.10.0 (Apache License 2.0)

`src/PdfPecker.Ocr.Gpu/Models/det.onnx.deflate`, `rec.onnx.deflate` and `cls.onnx.deflate` are these ONNX files from
the [rapidocr 3.10.0](https://pypi.org/project/rapidocr/3.10.0/) wheel (`rapidocr-3.10.0-py3-none-any.whl`, SHA-256
`2fc34e26cd0f48514804a94f8832283039c7334076bff60768b1fed9ad068050`), the same files PdfPecker.Ocr's own models are
converted from:

| PdfPecker.Ocr.Gpu file | File in the wheel | Upstream model | SHA-256 of the ONNX file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `det.onnx.deflate` | `rapidocr/models/PP-OCRv6_det_small.onnx` | PP-OCRv6_small_det | `090f04abcd9d9a7498bc4ebf677e4cb9bdce1fe4197ddb7e529f1ef44e1ff94f` |

The upstream model weights are copyright Baidu and/or the applicable PaddleOCR rights holders; the ONNX conversions
were made by the RapidOCR Authors. Both are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, reproduced below.

**The models are not changed.** `tools/ModelPacker` only compresses each file with deflate; the package inflates it to
the original bytes, which the tests check against the hashes above. The weights remain copyright of their rights
holders and are licensed under the Apache License 2.0, not under the MIT License.

The model notice shipped in the wheel (`rapidocr-3.10.0.dist-info/licenses/MODEL_LICENSES.md`) follows verbatim, its
headings nested under this section.

### RapidOCR Model License and Attribution Notice

This document records the license, copyright attribution, provenance, and
redistribution requirements for OCR model artifacts distributed by RapidOCR.
It does not replace or modify the Apache License, Version 2.0.

#### 1. Separate licensed works

RapidOCR contains two separately copyrighted categories of work:

1. **Source code and engineering components.** Copyright is held by the
   RapidOCR Authors. These components are licensed under the Apache License,
   Version 2.0, as described in the RapidOCR project `LICENSE` file.
2. **OCR model artifacts.** Copyright in the upstream model weights is held by
   Baidu and/or the applicable PaddleOCR rights holders. RapidOCR does not
   claim ownership of the upstream model weights.

Both categories are distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, but
their copyright ownership and provenance remain separate.

#### 2. Scope of this notice

This notice applies to the model artifacts listed in Section 6. Other model
artifacts available through RapidOCR may have different upstream versions or
terms and must be reviewed against their own source records before being
redistributed.

This notice does not automatically cover third-party models, datasets, fonts,
sample images, inference runtimes, or other assets that are not derived from
official PaddleOCR models. Those works remain subject to their own applicable
terms.

#### 3. Upstream attribution and licensing evidence

The models in Section 6 are released by, or derived from models released by,
the PaddleOCR project. PaddleOCR is released under the Apache License, Version
2.0. Official PaddlePaddle model cards identify the PP-OCRv6 model weights and
ONNX representations as `Apache-2.0`. PaddleOCR's official model list
identifies the legacy text angle classification model and its official
distribution source.

Upstream references:

- PaddleOCR project: <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR>
- PaddleOCR license: <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/main/LICENSE>
- PaddleOCR model list: <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/main/docs/version3.x/model_list.md>
- PaddleOCR ONNX conversion documentation: <https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleOCR/latest/en/version3.x/inference_deployment/others/obtaining_onnx_models.html>
- Official PP-OCRv6 small detection ONNX model card: <https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PP-OCRv6_small_det_onnx>
- Official PP-OCRv6 small recognition ONNX model card: <https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PP-OCRv6_small_rec_onnx>
- Official legacy text angle classification model list: <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR/blob/main/docs/version2.x/ppocr/model_list.en.md>

The legacy `ch_ppocr_mobile_v2.0_cls` model predates the official Hugging Face
model hosting and is identified through PaddleOCR's official model list and
model download service.

#### 4. Applicable license

The model artifacts in Section 6 are made available under the Apache License,
Version 2.0 (`Apache-2.0`). The complete license text is available at
<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>.

Subject to the conditions of Apache-2.0, the license permits use,
reproduction, modification, preparation of derivative works, public display,
sublicensing, and distribution in source or object form. These permissions are
not restricted to non-commercial use.

The license applies only to rights that the relevant licensors are authorized
to grant. No additional model-specific restriction has been identified for the
PaddleOCR-derived artifacts covered by this notice.

#### 5. Converted model artifacts

RapidOCR converts or repackages upstream PaddleOCR inference models for use
with supported inference engines. These conversions are mechanical
transformations of the model representation. Conversion does not transfer
ownership of the upstream weights to RapidOCR and does not remove the upstream
copyright or attribution.

RapidOCR distributes the converted artifacts in Section 6 under the same
Apache-2.0 terms that apply to the corresponding upstream PaddleOCR models. The
conversion and packaging scripts, configuration, and RapidOCR-authored
metadata are separately copyrighted by the RapidOCR Authors and licensed under
Apache-2.0 as part of the RapidOCR source code.

A RapidOCR-converted artifact may not be byte-for-byte identical to an ONNX or
other representation hosted by PaddlePaddle. Artifact identity must therefore
be established using its source record and cryptographic hash rather than its
filename alone.

#### 6. Bundled model artifacts

The following artifacts are covered by this notice and are distributed with
RapidOCR's default ONNX Runtime configuration:

| RapidOCR artifact | Upstream model | SHA-256 | RapidOCR source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PP-OCRv6_det_small.onnx` | `PP-OCRv6_small_det` | `090f04abcd9d9a7498bc4ebf677e4cb9bdce1fe4197ddb7e529f1ef44e1ff94f` | [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/RapidAI/RapidOCR/resolve/v3.9.2/onnx/PP-OCRv6/det/PP-OCRv6_det_small.onnx) |
| `PP-OCRv6_rec_small.onnx` | `PP-OCRv6_small_rec` | `6f327246b50388f3c176ae304bd95767ea6dc0c9ae92153ef8cbe210b3c14884` | [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/RapidAI/RapidOCR/resolve/v3.9.2/onnx/PP-OCRv6/rec/PP-OCRv6_rec_small.onnx) |
| `ch_ppocr_mobile_v2.0_cls_mobile.onnx` | `ch_ppocr_mobile_v2.0_cls` | `e47acedf663230f8863ff1ab0e64dd2d82b838fceb5957146dab185a89d6215c` | [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/RapidAI/RapidOCR/resolve/v3.9.2/onnx/PP-OCRv4/cls/ch_ppocr_mobile_v2.0_cls_mobile.onnx) |

The model registry in `rapidocr/default_models.yaml` is the authoritative
release record for the source URL and SHA-256 value of each supported model
artifact.

#### 7. Redistribution requirements

When redistributing a covered model artifact, or a modified or converted form
of one, comply with Section 4 of Apache-2.0. In particular, you must:

1. Give recipients a copy of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
2. Cause modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
   them.
3. Retain applicable copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
   from the upstream work, except notices that do not pertain to the
   redistributed work.
4. If an upstream distribution contains a `NOTICE` file, include the relevant
   contents of that notice in a permitted form.

At the time of publication, RapidOCR has not identified an additional
model-specific `NOTICE` file for the artifacts listed in Section 6. If a future
upstream release supplies one, its applicable contents must be retained.

For converted files, an appropriate modification notice is:

> Converted from an official PaddleOCR model to the indicated inference format
> and packaged for use with RapidOCR. The upstream model weights are copyright
> Baidu and/or the applicable PaddleOCR rights holders and are licensed under
> the Apache License, Version 2.0.

#### 8. Trademarks and endorsement

Apache-2.0 does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of Baidu, PaddlePaddle, PaddleOCR, or RapidOCR,
except as required for reasonable and customary description of the origin of
the model artifacts. Redistribution must not imply endorsement, sponsorship,
or affiliation without separate permission.

#### 9. Disclaimer

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the model artifacts
are provided on an **AS IS** basis, without warranties or conditions of any
kind. The warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability in Apache-2.0 apply.

Model accuracy, fitness, security, and regulatory suitability remain the
responsibility of the user and downstream distributor. RapidOCR is not a
medical device, and neither the model license nor this notice represents a
certification or guarantee for medical, safety-critical, or regulated use.

#### 10. Release maintenance

When a RapidOCR release adds or changes a model artifact, maintainers should:

1. Verify the upstream model and its applicable license.
2. Record the upstream source and immutable version or revision where
   available.
3. Record the conversion tool, tool version, model format, and conversion
   options where available.
4. Record and verify the artifact SHA-256 value.
5. Preserve any applicable upstream copyright, attribution, and `NOTICE`
   material.
6. Update this notice when the covered model families or applicable terms
   change.

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
